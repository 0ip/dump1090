dump1090-mutability (1.08.2302.14+1mu-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ask about json interval before json dir and skip the dir question if
    the interval is disabled, it makes more sense that way.
  * Be much more cautious about missing config settings so we don't explode
    so badly if something is omitted.
  * Use the package version as the version number compiled into the binary.
  * Add data/receiver.json (generated once) and support for it in script.js.
  * Internal webserver rearrangement to support multiple json files.
  * Dongle "device index" actually accepts serial numbers too, document that.
  * Add input validation to most of the config questions.
