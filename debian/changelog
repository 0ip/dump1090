dump1090-mutability (1.10.3010.14mu-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Version-only rebuild to reflect the upstream dump1090 version we
    have merged from. Retaining the trailing build number to avoid
    confusion (as far as that's possible given this versioning system!)

dump1090-mutability (1.08.2302.14+1mu-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Notice if we lose the RTLSDR device, and try to reconnect when that happens.
    This lets you unplug/replug the RTLSDR without dump1090 exiting, and also
    lets dump1090 tolerate occasional USB glitches that make the dongle reset
    itself.
  * Fix some of the more glaring pthread bugs.
  * Center the webmap on the receiver location.
  * Mark config.js as a conffile, so user changes won't get overwritten.

dump1090-mutability (1.08.2302.14+1mu-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ask about json interval before json dir and skip the dir question if
    the interval is disabled, it makes more sense that way.
  * Be much more cautious about missing config settings so we don't explode
    so badly if something is omitted.
  * Use the package version as the version number compiled into the binary.
  * Add data/receiver.json (generated once) and support for it in script.js.
  * Internal webserver rearrangement to support multiple json files.
  * Dongle "device index" actually accepts serial numbers too, document that.
  * Add input validation to most of the config questions.
