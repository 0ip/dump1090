dump1090-fa (3.1.0) stable; urgency=medium

  * Update to latest dump1090-mutability master
  * Preserve more map settings in browser local storage
  * Add a NEXRAD weather layer (US only) to the map
  * Decoder overhaul/cleanup
  * Prefer ES data over Mode S data when both are available
  * Improved air/ground detection
  * Lots of map interface changes:
    * aircraft info moves to a draggable popup rather than top of the sidebar
    * sidebar is resizeable / hideable
    * table-only (no map) mode
    * improved FlightAware aircraft links
    * configurable units display (metric / imperial / aeronautical)
    * filter displayed aircraft by altitude
    * option to show all aircraft tracks
    * more aircraft markers
    * use aircraft markers based on aircraft type info where available
    * scale marker size based on zoom to avoid overlap when zoomed out
  * Include a greatly expanded aircraft type/registration database (used by the
    map display) based on the publically-distributable parts of FlightAware's
    internal database
  * Try to compute a registration from ICAO address for aircraft where there
    is a predictable mapping (e.g. US N-registrations)
  * Try to coexist with other packages (e.g. dump1090-mutability) that also
    provide a lighttpd config that changes the server.stat-cache-engine setting
  * Serve actual map data on port 8080, not just a redirect
  * Redirect requests for /dump1090-fa to /dump1090-fa/ rather than 404ing.
